<p> <span style="color:purple;font-weight:bold;">"Close-up of Brown Pitbull"</span> , by<span style="color:purple;font-weight:bold;"> Nacho</span> Licensed under <span style="color:purple;font-weight:bold;" >CC Pexel</span>

</p>

		<p>He was a lonely and quiet pitbull. No one liked him and thought that he was mean like all the other pitbulls. He never speaks so who knows if this is true or not. But he was not like the others.
