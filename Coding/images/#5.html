	<h1> Happy Bas Happy Life </h1>

	<p> Bas is the Pit bull that he always dreamt to be, it wasn't an easy road for him to get to where he is today but he did it none the less. He wanted everyone to see him for who he really was, back then he had a mean mug to hide how he felt. He was never given a chance to be understood and now that he has been given that one chance it changed who he is. He wants those that were in his position before to break out of that shell and discover what it is outside of what the call the comfort zone and meet new people and experience new things in life. And most importantly be yourself.
