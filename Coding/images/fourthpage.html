	<p> Since meetimg his new friends at the park Bas has changed his whole mood completely. His outlook on life has finally turned around for the better, he no longer is a quite person and is loved by everyone who sees him. You can't wipe that smile off his face if you wanted to, Bas is finally feeling like he has broke the curse that he felt has been haunting him his entire life.
